Each Windows message may have up to two parameters, wParam and lParam.
wParam contains two values, HIWORD and LOWORD
HIWORD is the notifacation message(if applicable)
LOWORD is the control or menu id that sent the message.
lParam is the HWND(window handle) to the control which sent the message or NULL if the messages isn't from a control.
a Message Loop:
    while(GetMessage(&Msg,NULL,0,0) > 0):
    {
        TranslateMessage(&Msg);
        DispatchMessage(&Msg);
    }
    GetMessage()    return a positive value indicating there is a message to be processed, and that it has filled in the members of the MSG structure we passed it.
                    return 0 if it hits WM_QUIT
                    return a negative value if an error occured
    
    TranslateMessage():
                    this does a bit of additional processing, translating virtual key messages into character messages.
    DispatchMessage():
                    what it does is take the message, checks which window it is for and then looks up the Window Procedure for the winodw.
                    it then calls that procedure, sending as parameters the handle of the window, the message, and wParam and lParam.
